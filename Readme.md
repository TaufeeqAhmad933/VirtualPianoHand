Virtual Piano with Hand Tracking
This project implements a virtual piano that can be played using hand gestures detected via your webcam. It leverages MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking and Pygame for sound playback and basic graphics.

Features
Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track your hand, specifically the index fingertip.

Virtual Keys: Displays a set of virtual piano keys (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) on the screen.

Sound Playback: Plays corresponding .wav sound files when your index fingertip "touches" a virtual key.

Debouncing: Includes a delay mechanism to prevent rapid, unintended repeated key presses.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+

A working webcam

Setup
Follow these steps to get the Virtual Piano up and running on your local machine:

Download the Project Files:

Save the virtual_piano.py file to a directory of your choice (e.g., VirtualPianoHand).

Create the sounds Directory:

Inside the VirtualPianoHand directory (where virtual_piano.py is located), create a new folder named sounds.

Add Sound Files:

Obtain .wav sound files for each note: A.wav, B.wav, C.wav, D.wav, E.wav, F.wav, G.wav.

Place these .wav files inside the sounds folder. You can find free piano sound samples online or record your own.

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to your project directory:

cd C:\Users\TAMEEZ\Desktop\VirtualPianoHand

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

.\venv\Scripts\Activate

(Your prompt should now show (venv) at the beginning)

Install Dependencies:

With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file (which you'll create next):

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Once you have completed the setup steps, ensure your virtual environment is active, and then run the main script:

python virtual_piano.py

Usage
After running the script, a new window will appear displaying your webcam feed.

You will see white rectangles at the bottom of the screen, representing the virtual piano keys (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).

Position your hand in front of the webcam. The application will track your hand, and a red circle will indicate your index fingertip.

To play a note, move your index fingertip over one of the white piano keys. The corresponding sound will play.

To exit the application, press the q key on your keyboard.

Troubleshooting
"Fatal error in launcher" during pip install: This often means your virtual environment is corrupted or was moved. Delete the venv folder and recreate it (refer to Setup Step 4).

No webcam feed / "Cannot open camera": Ensure your webcam is properly connected and not being used by another application. You might need to grant camera permissions to your terminal or IDE.

Laggy performance: Ensure good lighting conditions for hand tracking. Close other demanding applications to free up system resources.

No sound: Check your system's audio output. Ensure the .wav files are correctly placed in the sounds folder and are valid audio files.
